    <h3> Drift Night: Japan Originals </h3>
    <div id="para"> 
    <p> In Japan stylizing your car is more than what we think. To the owners the car is their canvas, and once modified to their liking, 
        it's a self represented rolling piece of art often formed by the owner and driven like an extention of themselves. Carving through the mountains.
         Shifting the gears. Knowing the blood busted knuckles, the sweat from the long hot nights working on the car, the tears of joy after getting the car to run after days of working on it,
         and the money sacrificed are all worth the moment of peace whilst drifting through a corner balancing grip and throttle, through an interconnected passion of man and machine. </p>
